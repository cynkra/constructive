\title{Constructive options class 'dm'}
\usage{
opts_dm(constructor = c("dm", "next", "list"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{constructor}{String. Name of the function used to construct the object.}

\item{...}{Additional options used by user defined constructors through the \code{opts} object}
}
\value{
An object of class <constructive_options/constructive_options_dm>
}
\description{
These options will be used on objects of class 'dm'.
}
\details{
Depending on \code{constructor}, we construct the object as follows:
\itemize{
\item \code{"dm"} (default): We use \code{dm::dm()} and other functions from \pkg{dm} to adjust the content.
This does not strictly reproduce the object because each dm calls creates different
\code{uuid} values for its tables, but the recreated object is functionally equivalent.
Use the "list" constructor for fully accurate reconstruction.
\item \code{"next"} : Use the constructor for the next supported class. Call \code{.class2()}
on the object to see in which order the methods will be tried.
\item \code{"list"} : Use \code{list()} and treat the class as a regular attribute.
}
}
