\title{Construct the session}
\usage{
construct_session(..., session_info = TRUE, library_calls = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Forwarded to \code{construct_multi()}. Should not include a \code{data} argument,
since \code{data} will be infered from attached packages.}

\item{session_info}{Whether to describe the setup in comments}

\item{library_calls}{Whether to include library calls}
}
\value{
An object of class 'constructive'.
}
\description{
This builds code to reproduce the session. By default it prints comments describing
the setup, attaching all non base packages present in the search path,
and constructs all objects present in the global environment. Objects exported
by attached package are used as data to sinplify  object construction.
}
\details{
More often than not it is not a perfectly faithful reproduction of the session,
in particular it doesn't account (yet?) for:
\itemize{
\item Namespaces loaded by other means than \code{library()} calls
\item Modifications of namespaces
\item Other environments on the search opath
\item Options that have been set
\item And most likely anything weirder than the above
}
